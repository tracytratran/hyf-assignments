### Recipe Collection App
---
1. The recipe data is stored in the database.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. These requests go to the backend's REST API endpoints (e.g. /api/recipes). The backend responses with JSON.
3. When a user adds a new recipe:  
- The frontend sends a POST request to the backend with the new recipe data in JSON format.
- The backend receives the request, then saves the recipe data to the database. 
- Once the data is successfully stored in the database, the database confirms to the backend, and the backend returns a success response (`201 Created`) to the frontend.
- The frontend receives the success response and will display a successful message (or whatever action to display when an user successfully adds a new recipe).

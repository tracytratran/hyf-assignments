### Reflection

---

1. From the assignment, I learned that AI can really be annoying with suggestions (totally off the topic when I don't ask for), but can be such a good teacher if I ask the right questions and ban them from giving me direct solutions. So far, they are two things I learned deeply from AI in the assignment task this week.

2. I need to correct almost every Copilot's autocompletion in 2 files: `index.html` and `styles.css` as it suggests most frequently used lines of codes, which are not what I need or care about at the moment.

3. I was not confident with adding interactivity through a button in this assignment. If I had used Copilot to generate codes for me, I would have understood but I didn't feel like I would remember this for long and would keep being back asking the same question in the future (like I don't own the codes). However, from what I have learned in class, I tried a different approach. I treated Copilot and ChatGPT (yes I used both) as my mentor/teacher and asked them the issue I faced.

   - This was how I started as I was so confused what I missed.

   - And when it came back with questions only, I became clearer about what I missed to complete the task and what to look for. The Q&A approach enabled me to think and figure out the way to do the task with right questions asked. I know better and will for sure remember deeper about how to get a random color using JavaScript from now on.

4. I think if I rely heavily on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture, there will be of course significant risks:

   - I will not own the code I have written, thus will not grow and become better than I was day 1 at HackYourFuture.

   - I will waste so much time of myself, HYF mentors and other people trying to helping me in this journey with HYF.

   - I will eventually can't work without AI, thus will not be skillful and confident enough to secure a place in Software Development.
